# Unit 03 Mid-Unit Assessment
##### 1. All the parts of the app were completed
##### 2. Intents and passing data between activities were easy, RecyclerView was also a known thing
##### 3. It took me some time to figure out how to start an intent from ItemViewHolder because there was no activity. I think it would be great to learn more about what context is and how useful it is. In my case it was useful to start an intent. Retreiving data from SharedPrefs HashMap was also not a trivial thing. Would like to learn more about that.
